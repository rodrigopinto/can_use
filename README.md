[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rodrigopinto/can_use.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rodrigopinto/can_use)

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  can_use:
    github: rodrigopinto/can_use
```
2. Run `shards install`

## Usage


1. Require the library on your code base.

	```crystal
	require "can_use"
	```

2. Create a file with the features toggle definitions.
We suggest to name it as `featutes.yaml`, but it is up to you.

	**Note:** The `defaults` block is mandatory, as it will be used as fallback when values are not defined on the environment set on `configuration`. Example:

	```yaml
	defaults:
	  new_payment_flow: false
	  rating_service: false

	development:
	  new_payment_flow: true
	  rating_service: false

	your_environment:
	  new_payment_flow: true
	```

3. Configure the environment and the path to the yaml.

	```crystal
	CanUse.configure do |config|
	  config.file = "path/to/features.yaml"
	  config.environment = "your_environment"
	end
	```

4. Verify if a feature is toggled on/off

	```crystal
	if CanUse.feature?("new_payment_flow")
	  # do_something
	end
	```


## Development

1. Install the dependencies.

	```bash
	$ shards install
	```

2. Implement and test your changes.

	```bash
	$ crystal spec
	```


3. Run fomart tool to verify code style.

	```bash
	$ crystal tool format
	```

## TODO

- [ ] Add ability to toggle on/off a feature programatically, ex: `CanUse.enable("feature")`.
- [ ] Allows ENVIRONMENT variables to set/override a value for a key.
